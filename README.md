# Medical Appointment System â€” Full Stack Web App

This is a full-stack medical appointment booking system that allows users to register, browse doctors, book appointments, make payments, and leave reviews. The project is divided into a backend API (Node.js + Express) and a frontend client (React).

## Features

- User registration and login
- Browse and search for doctors
- Book and manage appointments
- Submit and view reviews for doctors
- Secure payment integration
- Role-based access logic (e.g., patient/admin)
- Modular and scalable code architecture

## Installation & Running

### Project Setup

From the **root directory** of the project (`SWE_Project/`):

```bash
npm install
```

This will install dependencies for both `frontend` and `backend`, assuming you've set up proper scripts in the root `package.json` to forward the install.

---

### Run the Full App (Frontend + Backend)

Simply run:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will **automatically start both** the backend server and the React frontend using a custom script defined in the root `package.json`.

> Internally, this uses tools like `concurrently` to run:
> - `npm start` in `backend/` (Express server)
> - `npm start` in `frontend/` (React app)

The app will open in your default browser at:  
`http://localhost:3000` (Frontend)  
`http://localhost:PORT` (Backend, as defined in `.env`)
